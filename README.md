## Usage

## Acknowledgment

- Inspired by [alfred-gitlab](https://github.com/lukewaite/alfred-gitlab)
- Powered by [Alfred-Workflow](https://www.deanishe.net/alfred-workflow/index.html) python module

## Misc

- [How to add dynamic repo thumbnails in alfred-workflow](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow/issues/106#issuecomment-737505965)
- The Gitea API does not return `x-next-page` and `x-page` headers, therefore the total number of pages needs to be calculated on the fly in every run
